 * It states that, software entities(classes, Modules, Methods etc.) should be open for extension
 * but closed for modification.
 * 1. OPEN FOR EXTENSION:- it basically means that we should be able to extend existing behavior.
 * 2. CLOSED FOR MODIFICATION:- It means that whatever code is already written should not be changed.
 * So this principle is basically telling us to avoid or to completely avoid modifying existing base
 * classes and using inheritance and overriding in order to achieve extension of existing behavior.
